I'm a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) in San Francisco, where I lead a small team that mostly works on [NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf).

At Google I've worked on [Glass](https://www.google.com/glass/start/), [Lens Blur](https://ai.googleblog.com/2014/04/lens-blur-in-new-google-camera-app.html), [HDR+](https://ai.googleblog.com/2014/10/hdr-low-light-and-high-dynamic-range.html), [VR](https://blog.google/products/google-ar-vr/introducing-next-generation-jump/), [Portrait Mode](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/portrait-mode-on-pixel-2-and-pixel-2-xl.html), [Portrait Light](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/12/portrait-light-enhancing-portrait.html), and [Maps](https://blog.google/products/maps/three-maps-updates-io-2022/). I did my PhD at [UC Berkeley](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/), where I was advised by [Jitendra Malik](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~malik/). I've received the [PAMI Young Researcher Award](https://www.thecvf.com/?page_id=413#YRA).
